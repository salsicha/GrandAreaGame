	Welcome to the play testing site for my game.<br><br>Imagine that WWII has come and gone and that the thirst for military domination has gone out of the world. In this post-colonialist world, power is gained through coercion and exploitation. The most fought over thing on the planet, oil, is beginning its gradual depletion, but it is still the largest factor driving the world's economies and armies. <br><br>Your mission is to conquer the world. But you will not be able to do it by driving your war machine around the globe. You must use less direct means to conquer countries and fill your coffers.
