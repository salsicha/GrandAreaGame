			Your country is highlighted green. If you can't see it, then it is really small.
			Country capitals are marked by green dots on the map.
			Country indices are marked from lowest value (black) to highest (light blue).
			Action arrows are drawn from the aggressor's capital, to the target's capital.<br><br>

			This game is based on the Mafia System. Every country is ruled by an oligarchy. The oligarchies battle each other for money and power. They use the same tactics that a regular mafia family would.<br><br>

			Each country is measured by its Total Wealth (Net GDP), Family Wealth (Oligarchy wealth. Net GDP multiplied by an inequality index for that society), Human Development (average of education level, health care, and buying power), Armed Forces (size of army), and Fuel Exports.<br><br><br>

			ACTIONS<br>
			- Skim: A Family can attempt to skim off the national income. This raises inequality (Gini Index) in the country and lowers the Human Development rating<br>
			(raises gini coefficient)<br><br>
			- Invade: If a country invades another country (and wins) then Total Wealth and Armed Forces is reduced for both nations. The attacker's Armed Forces index is reduced in proportion to the defender's Armed Forces rating. The invading country automatically Exploits the loser as its next action. If the attack fails then Total Wealth and Human Development for both countries decreases.<br>
			(lowers total wealth of attacker and defender. if the attack succeeds then the attacker exploits the loser and the loser's human development is lowered)<br><br>
			- Sanction: A sanctioned country has its access to international markets cut off, in proportion to the number of Families sanctioning it and their combined wealth. The sanctioned country's Total Wealth is reduced by the same proportion.<br>
			(lowers total wealth of target, lowers human development)<br><br>
			- Coup: In the case of a successful coup then the attacker's Family starts a new branch in the defender's government. The new Family branch is a separate player, and is automatically Exploited by the parent family. The aggressor's Family Wealth is reduced by the coup attempt.<br>
			(if the player is successful then the target is exploited)<br><br>
			- Protect: A country adopting a protectionist stance raises taxes and tariffs and spends the money on Human Development. Protect cancels all Exploits effecting the country. In addition the country can't invade, coup or exploit another country. Its Family Wealth (Gini Index) is reduced and its Human Development is increased.<br>
			(lowers gini coefficient, raises total wealth, raises human development, cancels all exploitations)<br><br>
			
			- Exploited<br>
			(raises gini coefficient of target, takes part of total wealth from target and gives it to player. the amount is based on the fuel exports of the country, lowers human development)<br><br><br>
			
			VICTORY CONDITIONS<br>
			1. Become the new superpower by having a Total Wealth in excess of the US.<br>
			2. Coup the US government by having a Family Wealth large enough to do so.<br>
			3. Break the Mafia System.<br><br><br>

			Notes:<br>
			A country can only be exploited by one country at a time. If a country attempts to coup another country that is being exploited, then the exploiting country's family wealth is added to the exploited country's family wealth to resolve the conflict.<br><br>
			A coup or invasion should be modified by the distance of the action (length of vector). An invasion should be decided the attacker's standing army minus distance versus the defender's. A coup should be decided by the family wealth minus distance versus the defender's family wealth.<br><br>
			What are the caps? If the Human Development gets too low, there is a revolt, if the Human Development gets too high, there is a revolution. A revolt would be the same thing as protectionism. What is too low or too high? I could make a new table with the starting values to compare against, and say too low or too high is within 50% of the starting value.<br><br><br>

ToDo:

Optimizations
- the target play time should be about one hour
- optimization: Put db in parity with array
- optimization: Precompute lat lon values
- under cancel list all previous actions for player ?
- countries divided equally among players ?
- display the player's indices on the screen ?
- show all player's indices on roll over of country ?
- armies... combats should take several minutes in real time, but the victor is automatically computed ?

Style
- maybe it should always show the exploit and sanction arrows from the player's country
- risk domination feeling? show exploitation blocks as the default view, your country in bright green, and your exploited country in a dim green
- monopoly race feeling? probably not appropriate 
- family wealth win? skim and allow exploiting of you country, but then get military support from another country to to prevent a revolt
- what advantage is there to carefully picking your attack order? how much Oil you have, the size of the defender's army, whether they will fall to a sanction
- this game is a replay of the cold war, starting with the end of WWII
