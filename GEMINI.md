The objective is to make a game for boardgamearena, using javascript on hte front end and php on the back end. The game is described below.

The game will feature a map of the world, similar to Risk.


1. Benevolent Cover (The PR Shield)
The Action: You frame a military intervention or a corporate resource grab as a "Crusade for Democracy" or "Humanitarian Aid."

The Benefit: Reduces "Domestic Dissent" and prevents the "International Pariah" status. It allows you to keep tax-paying citizens supportive of the defense budget.

The Complication: "The Credibility Gap." If the intervention lasts too long or the "Strong Regime" you installed commits a massacre that leaks to the press (e.g., the My Lai massacre or the El Mozote massacre), your Benevolent Cover shatters. This triggers a Mass Protest Event, temporarily freezing your ability to send military aid.

2. Direct Intervention (The Iron Fist)
The Action: You bypass subversion and send in the Marines, or launch "Secret Bombing" campaigns (as in Laos).

The Benefit: High success rate. It immediately resets the "Independent Development" meter of a target country to zero, effectively "killing the rot."

The Complication: "The Soviet Pivot." Chomsky notes that when you unleash terror, the victims have "nowhere else to turn." Direct intervention drastically increases the chance that the target country becomes a Soviet Client. You "win" the battle by destroying their schools and hospitals, but you "lose" the territory to your rival's sphere of influence, forcing a long-term, expensive military standoff.

3. Capital Flight (The Economic Noose)
The Action: You organize an international boycott, freeze the target country's bank accounts, and withdraw all private investment.

The Benefit: Destroys the target government’s ability to provide for its people without firing a single shot. It makes the "Communist" (populist) government look incompetent.

The Complication: "The Black Market Leak." Prolonged economic warfare creates a power vacuum. Organized crime or rival factions (like the China player) may move in to provide "Alternative Credit." Furthermore, if you crash a large enough economy (like Brazil), you risk a Global Recession, which lowers your own "Wealth Disparity" score by hurting your own corporations’ quarterly profits.

4. The Fifth Freedom (The Freedom to Rob)
The Action: You install a "National Security State"—a military dictatorship that guarantees foreign firms can repatriate 100% of profits.

The Benefit: Maximum "Investment Climate" score. Your wealth generation spikes as you extract raw materials at sub-market costs.

The Complication: "The Refugee Surge." By destroying the "human rights climate" and the "living standards" of the local population to ensure the freedom to rob, you make the country unlivable. This generates a Migration Wave toward your own borders. In-game, this increases "Internal Xenophobia" and "Political Polarization" in the U.S. faction, making it harder to pass unified Grand Area policies.
