The objective is to make a game for boardgamearena, using javascript on hte front end and php on the back end. The game is described below.

The game is inspired by the Grand Area and the Mafia Principle, as described by Noam Chomsky.

The game will feature a map of the world, similar to Risk.

You can play any country, they all have their own regional issues

Every country consists of:
The Family 
The Government 
The people 

The family tries to use the government to coerce the people, and sway the people to check the government 

The family loses if they lose control of the government or the people or both

The family has:
Personal capital 
Political capital 
Social capital 

When any of their capital values reach zero they lose 

The government, on behalf of the family can:
Invade 
Sanction
Coup

The family can skim, which raises their personal capital but lowers their social capital 

Countries have to secure natural resources, withou resources like oil domestically or controlled through a client family, their economy suffers

Indices for each country:
Family income
National income
National happiness
Armies
Education
Development
Resources

Actions:
Skim/launder own economy
Exploit enemy economy
Invade
Sanction
Coup attempt
Protect own economy
Offer protection to another country

Every family is either a:
Head family (USA)
Regional family (UK, France, Japan, etc...)
Client family

Every action has a cost to the Family’s reputation and the Country’s stability.

Your "Country" has a population that doesn't know they are being run by a Mafia. If your Family Net Value grows too fast while the Country Wealth drops, you trigger an Uprising. You must spend "Benevolent Cover" points to convince the public that the "Hit" you just ordered was actually "Promotion of Democracy."

If a client country's family decides to use their Country Wealth to feed their people instead of paying the controlling Family, they have committed the ultimate sin: Defiance. * Result: The controlling Family must "make an example" of them. If they don't, other families will stop paying tribute.

If a client country's family decides leave the global system. The controlling Family must "make an example" of them. If they don't, other families will stop paying tribute.

In this game, you don't just "do" things; you "frame" them:
...

The "Debt Shakedown" (IMF/World Bank Mechanic)
...

The regional families are trying to become the head family, the client families are trying to become regional or to break the system by becoming independant. The system only allows resource poor states to be independant
