The objective is to make a game for boardgamearena, using javascript on the front end and php on the back end. The game is described below.

The game is inspired by the Grand Area and the Mafia Principle, as described by Noam Chomsky.

The game will feature a map of the world, similar to Risk.

You can play any country, they all have their own regional issues


Every country consists of:
The Family 
The Government 
The people 

The family tries to use the government to coerce the people, and sway the people to check the government 

The family loses if they lose control of the government or the people or both

The family has:
Personal capital 
Political capital 
Social capital 

When any of their capital values reach zero they lose 

The government, on behalf of the family can:
Invade 
Sanction
Coup

The family can skim, which raises their personal capital but lowers their social capital 

Countries have to secure natural resources, without resources like oil domestically or controlled through a client family, their economy suffers

Indices for each country:
Family income
National income
National happiness
Armies
Education
Development
Resources

Actions:
Skim/launder own economy
Exploit enemy economy
Invade
Sanction
Coup attempt
Protect own economy
Offer protection to another country

Every family is either a:
Head family (USA)
Regional family (UK, France, Japan, etc...)
Client family

Every action has a cost to the Family’s reputation and the Country’s stability.

Your "Country" has a population that doesn't know they are being run by a Mafia. If your Family Net Value grows too fast while the Country Wealth drops, you trigger an Uprising. You must spend "Benevolent Cover" points to convince the public that the "Hit" you just ordered was actually "Promotion of Democracy."

If a client country's family decides to use their Country Wealth to feed their people instead of paying the controlling Family, they have committed the ultimate sin: Defiance. * Result: The controlling Family must "make an example" of them. If they don't, other families will stop paying tribute.

If a client country's family decides leave the global system. The controlling Family must "make an example" of them. If they don't, other families will stop paying tribute.

The "Ministry of Truth" (The Narrative Engine)
In this game, you don't just "do" things; you "frame" them:

The "Debt Shakedown" (IMF/World Bank Mechanic)
The Mafia doesn't just take resources; they lend money the victim can’t pay back.

The "Rotten Apple" Theory (Contagion)
This is the core of the "Example" mechanic.
The Threat of a Good Example: If a small Client country successfully increases Education and National Happiness without the Head Family's help, it emits a "Defiance Aura."

The "Intelligence Services" (The Consigliere)
The Family needs a layer between them and the "Government" to handle the dirty work.
The Black Budget: A hidden pool of Personal Capital used to fund Coup Attempts without a public vote.
False Flags: A high-level action where you attack your own Armies or Resources and blame a Defiant country to gain a "Casus Belli" (Justification for War), resetting your Benevolent Cover to maximum.

The regional families are trying to become the head family, the client families are trying to become regional or to break the system by becoming independant. The system only allows resource poor states to be independant


Every round a client state tries to become independent and nationalize its resources 

Map needs to show boss, regional and client states, and what resources each state has

Families want to make money, they do so by using their government to force clients to open to exploitation, but they do so with public backlash. They can also exploit their own people. If they allow their own people to be exploited too much they risk. If they don’t share power they can be coup’d. If they share too much they lose influence. 

The US players main threat is losing political or social capital and losing power. Same is true for many western regional families. Coups are basically impossible 

Non-western families are dictators can only be coup’d, but not sharing power puts the coup threat always high 

Running a coup from us has high risk of losing influence 

Every round a client tries for independence, all the families play their action in secret, all the cards are revealed and resolved from weakest family to strongest 

Defiance actions have a rolling effect where other nations start demanding independence also until the inciting revolt is crushed 

Phase 1: The Incident (The "Grito")
Phase 2: The Response (The "Sit-Down")
Phase 3: The "Narrative" Battle
Phase 4: Resolution (The "Example")

Crisis deck
(See crisis deck card)

Every client nation has an desire for independence sentiment value that changes during the game 

Every family run nation has a desire for change of governance sentiment. If the social or political capital of it’s family gets too low and desires for change too high, doing a coup against them becomes easy

Client nations have a factional division value. The higher the division the easier a coup against them

On the map every client nation needs to display what nation they are a client of
