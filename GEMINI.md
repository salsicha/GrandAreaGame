The objective is to make a game for boardgamearena, using javascript on hte front end and php on the back end. The game is described below:

1. The Core Concept: "The Fifth Freedom"
In most strategy games, you "win" by improving your citizens' lives. In Grand Area, the player represents the "Planners" (the Council on Foreign Relations/State Department). Your goal is not the prosperity of the world, but the maintenance of disparity. You must keep the U.S. at 50% of the world's wealth with only 6% of its population.

2. Player Actions: The Tools of Subordination
Instead of building hospitals or schools in foreign territories, your actions focus on "improving the investment climate.""Preventing the Rot": If a country (e.g., Nicaragua or Laos) starts spending its budget on health, education, or land reform, you must intervene. These are "Nationalist" threats that must be framed as "Communist" threats to justify action."The Threat of a Good Example": You must destroy successful social programs in small, weak countries (like Laos) specifically so other countries don't see that independent development is possible."Managing the Fifth Freedom": Deploy "Police Repression" by funding local "thugs" and "death squads." As Chomsky notes, a "strong regime" (military dictatorship) is preferable to a "liberal government" that is "indulgent" toward its own people."Driving them into the arms of the USSR": Paradoxically, you may take actions to force a resisting country to seek help from the Soviet Union. This "justifies" your subsequent invasion or embargo to the domestic public."Information Management": You must spend "Ideological Points" to ensure the domestic U.S. population believes you are acting out of "disinterested benevolence" and "altruism," even while your internal memos (Top Secret documents) admit the goal is power.

3. Key Mechanics: The "Investment Climate" vs. "Human Rights"
The game would feature two inverse meters:Investment Climate: High levels allow U.S. corporations to repatriate profits. This is increased by "murdering priests" or "torturing peasant organizers" (actions cited by Chomsky as historically effective for business).Human Rights/Standard of Living: If this meter goes up, your "Wealth Disparity" score goes down. To "win," you must keep this meter as low as possible in the "Grand Area."

4. Victory Conditions
Unlike a typical game where you conquer the map, your victory is defined by stasis:The Disparity Goal: Maintain a specific ratio of world wealth (e.g., 50%) for your domestic elite.The Resource Monopoly: Ensure "our raw materials" (which happen to be under other people’s land) are never used by the indigenous populations for their own benefit.The Compliance Score: Every country in the "Grand Area" (Western Hemisphere, Far East, former British Empire) must remain "complementary to the industrial economies of the West."

Summary of Gameplay Loop
You identify a "heresy" (a country raising its literacy rate) 
You label it "Communist"
You fund a "National Security State" (military coup)
The Investment Climate improves
You use "Ideological Slogans" to explain the resulting massacre as a "failed crusade for democracy" to your home audience.
